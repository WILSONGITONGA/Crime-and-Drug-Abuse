# Crime-and-Drug-Abuse
In this project, I explored the complex relationship between substance abuse and various criminal activities, using Excel-based data analytics and visualization to uncover critical insights. The goal was to help a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) understand how drug abuse impacts criminal behavior, supporting their efforts to address this issue more effectively.

## Project OverView.
The NGO had been grappling with a rising wave of crimes—ranging from theft and vandalism to assault—that appeared linked to increasing levels of drug abuse. However, they lacked the tools and insights necessary to grasp the full scope of the problem. This project aimed to provide the NGO with data-driven insights into the dynamics between substance abuse and crime, allowing them to allocate resources more effectively and design preventative strategies.
### Challenges the NGO faced:
- **Lack of Data Integration:** The NGO collected data from various sources, but it was centralized, making it hard to analyze the trends comprehensively.
- **Resource Allocation:** Limited resources were being allocated to address drug-related crime, and without accurate insights, the NGO couldn’t optimize its efforts.
- **Inefficient Reporting:** Reporting methods were time-consuming, and they were not data-driven, making it difficult to identify trends.
- **No Predictive Capabilities:** The organization was unable to anticipate future crime hotspots or trends related to substance abuse.

## Rationale for the Project.
To illustrate the connection between substance, abuse and criminal activities, I considered the following scenarios:
- **Drug-Fueled Violence:** An increase in violent crimes, such as domestic violence and aggravated assault, can be directly linked to substance abuse. A detailed analysis can reveal the substances involved and the specific demographics affected.
- **Overdose Incidents:** Tracking overdose incidents can shed light on the most prevalent drugs in the community and highlight areas in need of addiction treatment and education programs.
- **Gang Involvement:** Substance abuse often plays a role in gang-related activities, Analyzing connections between gang members and drug-related offenses can aid in dismantling criminal networks.
- **Drug Trafficking Hotspots:** Identifying areas with high drug trafficking activities can help law enforcement agencies allocate resources for interdiction efforts.

## Aim of the Project.
1. **Data Integration and validation:** Establish robust data integration processes to compile and validate diverse datasets related to substance abuse and criminal activities, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
2. **Descriptive Analysis:** Perform descriptive data analysis to summarize key statistics and metrics related to drug-related crimes.
3. **Frequencies, location trends, and drug types involved.**
4. **Trend Identification:** Identify and document temporal trends in drug-related crimes, such as seasonal variations or long-term increases or decreases, using time-series analysis.
5. **Location Analysis:** Conduct location-based analysis to pinpoint geographical hotspots of drug-related criminal activities, supporting focused law enforcement efforts.
6. **Data Visualization:** Develop clear and intuitive data visualizations, such a charts, graphs, using  Excel to present analytical findings for easy interpretation by stakeholders.
## Data Description.
- ***Incident_ID:*** A unique identifier for each incident.
- ***Crime_Type:*** The type of crime committed in the incident (e.g., Theft, Vandalism, Assault).
- ***Crime_Location:*** The location where the crime took place (e.g., Urban, Downtown, Rural).
- ***Crime_DateTime:*** The date and time when the crime occurred.
- ***Crime_Details:*** A brief description of the specific details of the crime in each incident.
- ***Drug_Type:*** The type of drugs involved or related to the incident (e.g., Heroin, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Marijuana).
- ***Abuser_Age:*** The age of the individual involved in the incident.
- ***Abuser_Gender:*** The gender of the individual involved in the incident.
- ***Treatment_History:*** Indicates whether the individual involved in the incident has a history of drug addiction treatment (e.g., "Yes" or "No").
- ***Demographic_Data:*** Information about the demographic background of the individual involved, such as their living area and income level.
- ***Arrest_Record:*** Indicates whether the individual was arrested in connection with the incident (e.g., "Arrested" or "Not Arrested").
- ***Conviction_Record:*** Indicates whether the individual has a prior conviction related to the incident (e.g., "Convicted" or "Not Convicted").
- ***Police_Activity:*** Describes the police activity related to the incident (e.g., "Investigating," "Patrolling," "Responding").
- ***Hospital_Admission:*** Indicates whether the individual was admitted to a hospital as a result of the incident (e.g., "Yes" or "No").
- ***Overdose_Incident:*** Indicates whether the incident involved an overdose (e.g., "Yes" or "No").
- ***Addiction_Treatment:*** Specifies whether the individual is receiving addiction treatment as a result of the incident (e.g., "Inpatient" or "Outpatient").
## project Scope
1.	**Data Cleaning and Validation:** Cleaning data to ensure accuracy, addressing missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formats.
2.	**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used Excel’s pivot tables to explore crime types, locations, drug types involved, and demographic data.
3.	**Data Visualization:** Created charts and graphs to visualize trends, including crime frequencies, types of drugs involved, and geographic crime hotspots.
4.	**Excel Dashboard Creation:** Developed a highly interactive Excel dashboard for stakeholders to easily interpret the insights.
5.	**Insights and Recomendations:** I offered Insights and recommendations to the Organization.
## Tech Stack Used.
I utilized Excel to perform comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Descriptive**, and **Diagnostic Analytics**. These methodologies allowed me to explore key statistics, identify trends, and uncover correlations between substance abuse and criminal activities.
### Questions Explored:
- What is the correlation between drug types and crime rates?
- Which areas experience the most drug-related crimes?
- What are the age and gender demographics of individuals involved in these crimes?
- How does income level influence crime?
- What police activities are most common during these incidents?
## Insights Uncovered.
By applying **Descriptive** and **Diagnostic Analytics**, I discovered several actionable insights that were critical for the NGO’s decision-making process:
1.	**Peak Crime Months:** Crimes were at their highest in August and lowest in February, indicating possible seasonal trends.
2.	**Common Crime Types:** Theft was the most common crime, followed by burglary. Assault incidents were relatively low.
3.	**Urban Crime Hotspots:** Urban areas had the highest crime rates, with Downtown areas following closely, while rural areas reported the least.
4.	**Gender Demographics:** Males were involved in 70% of the incidents, while females contributed to 30%.
5.	**Drug Involvement:** Marijuana was the drug most commonly associated with criminal activities, whereas Methamphetamine-related incidents were rare.
6.	**Income Influence:** Low-income individuals were involved in the most criminal incidents, followed by middle-income individuals.
7.	**Police Response:** Most crimes occurred when police were responding to incidents, rather than during patrolling or investigating phases.
8.	**Conviction Rates:** Across most drug types, individuals were more likely to not be convicted than to face conviction.

## Recommendations.
Based on the data analysis, I provided the following recommendations to the NGO:
- **Crime Prevention Strategies:** Invest in community awareness campaigns focusing on the prevention of theft and petty crimes.
- **Resource Allocation:** Focus police resources on urban areas, which experienced the highest crime rates.
- **Patrolling Strategy:** Re-evaluate police patrolling schedules, particularly since most crimes happen while police are responding, rather than patrolling.
## Key Skills Demonstrated.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified critical trends and correlations using real-world healthcare and crime data.
- **Descriptive & Diagnostic Analytics:** Applied these methods to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights.
- **Data Visualization:** Created clear, impactful visualizations that made it easy for stakeholders to understand complex data.
- **Excel Reporting:** Developed an interactive dashboard using Excel, allowing stakeholders to explore the data and insights effortlessly.
